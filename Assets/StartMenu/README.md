# Buttons & Menu

In this folder I have created a custom shader + material that
is controlled by the ButtonControl script. The inner color,
border color, hover color and pressed color are all controlled
by the script. The OnClick action is also set by the script. 

The start menu has a Start button which loads a sample scene, an 
options button with no action and a quit button which quits the game.
